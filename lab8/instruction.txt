Instructions
Create a function expression named createBicyclePrototye which returns an object literal with one property speed set to value 0 and two methods
applyBrake that takes a parameter and decrement the current speed of the object by that given value.
speedup that takes a parameter increment current speed by given value.
Create another function expression named createMountainBikeProtoype   that take a prototype parameter and returns an object created using Object.create (prototype) with one additional property gear set to value 1 and one additional method setGear which takes a parameter and sets gear value for the object.
Write third function expression named start that first make bicyclePrototype object using first function and then mountainBikePrototype object using second function, passing bicyclePrototype as argument.
Now create some objects from both bicyclePrototype and mountainBikePrototype using Object.create() and play with it. (do some console.log)
Wrap all three functions in a module so that we have only one module variable in the global name space.
Make use of 'use strict' at the top of your module.
Now, try to achieve above functionality, this time using ES6 class construct.


Optional

Finally, do it using constructor function
